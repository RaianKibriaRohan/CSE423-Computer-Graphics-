# CSE423-Computer-Graphics
Here I have compiled all my mini projects through out this course. Key library: **OpenGL**

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-platform, industry-standard API used for rendering 2D and 3D graphics. It provides a set of functions for interacting with graphics hardware, allowing developers to create visually rich applications such as video games, simulations, and graphical user interfaces. OpenGL is widely used in fields such as computer graphics, CAD, virtual reality, and scientific visualization. It works with a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, and Python, and is supported by most operating systems and hardware platforms.
